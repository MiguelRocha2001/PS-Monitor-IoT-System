# PS-Monitor-IoT-System

This repo holds all the work done for our final project's course (LEIC - ISEL).

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way machines work and communicate
with people and other systems. Our main objective consists in the creation of a smart
and automated system, using IoT technology, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
an industrial filtration process. By incorporating sensors into these filters, we can detect
problems before they lead to costly downtime or safety hazards. The sensors will collect
data relative to the filtration systemâ€™s environment, such as the water temperature and pH.
All this data is to be sent to a central server, and through real-time data analysis, we will
identify if the filtration system is not working optimally or is closer to failure. In these
situations, an alert will be sent to a device controlled by the filtration system operator or
manager, enabling them to take prompt action to resolve the issue. Our project seeks to
improve efficiency, reduce costs and increase safety by automating the fault detection process
of filtration system inspection.
